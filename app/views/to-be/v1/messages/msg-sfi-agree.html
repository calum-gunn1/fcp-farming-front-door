          Thank you for accepting your agreement offer.
          
           
          
          Your SFI agreement will start from 01 November 2023. It comprises:
          
           
          
          your agreement document, which you can view in the Rural Payments service
          
          your agreement’s terms and conditions
          
          the SFI actions you have chosen
          
          You can find more information about your SFI agreement, including your agreement’s terms and conditions and the details of the SFI actions, in the SFI handbook (search GOV.UK for ‘SFI handbook’).
          
           
          
          Upgrading your SFI agreement
          
           
          
          You can upgrade your SFI agreement to add more SFI actions and land. To do this, you must submit an ‘upgrade request’ towards the end of the first and second years of your 3-year SFI agreement. This must be done by the relevant deadline. We’ll tell you what date that is.
          
           
          
          Read the information about requesting changes to your SFI agreement in the SFI handbook to find out more about upgrading your agreement (search GOV.UK for ‘SFI handbook’).
          
           
          
          What happens if you find you cannot comply with your agreement
          
           
          
          Something may happen for reasons within or outside your control (‘a change of circumstances’) which means you cannot comply with your SFI agreement. If this is the case, you must tell us about this, in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable.
          
           
          
          When you write to us, you should include:
          
           
          
          your Single Business Identifier (SBI), which is shown above
          
          your SFI agreement reference number, which you can find on your agreement document
          
          as many details as possible about the change of circumstances, including specific details about the SFI actions you’re having issues with
          
          Read the SFI handbook to find out more about what happens if you find you cannot comply with your agreement (search GOV.UK for ‘SFI handbook’).
